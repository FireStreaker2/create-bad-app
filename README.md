# About
create-bad-app is a CLI tool built with Node.js. It generates all the files needed to create a bad app, quickly and efficiently.

# Notes
create-bad-app automatically creates three files: ``index${extension}``, ``LICENSE``, and ``README.md``. The license file is automatically set to the MIT license, and the README file is a simple file saying that it was generated with create-bad-app. ``index${extension}`` however, is just a blank file.
